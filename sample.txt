It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.

It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00PWSAXAM	Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity	Only use twice a week	I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.

15	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B0019QITHK	Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black	Color Is Accurate	I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen.

I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.
18	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000HE8NK8	Barnett Diablo Slingshot	good enough	As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.

I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time.

It's like they didn't test it to see if it works.
26	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B0018KL0YG	Oregano Oil CERTIFIED ORGANIC- Joy of the Mountain - 75% Carvacrol (30mL) Brand: Joy of the Mountain	Did you know? Oregano delivers more antioxidants than blueberries, oranges or apples	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.

We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years.

It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer.

It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz	Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!
35	__label1__	3	N	Camera	B0049I48JI	Nikon Deluxe Digital SLR Camera Case - Gadget Bag	hard to accommodate	The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture.

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(

39	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B005HXTMYA	Protocol For Life Balance - Red Yeast Rice Plus 600 mg 90 vcaps	The best natural product to lower cholesterol	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!

41	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B000F5PM4E	Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets	My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

44	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B00028P640	Natural Factors Pycnogenol Pine Bark 25mg Capsules, 60-Count	The Gift of Life from Trees! Fountain of youth	My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />"So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.

They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.

10502	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00ICAKJJW	Power Wheels Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kawasaki KFX	Great fun for little ones. But be sure you fully charge before use.	This is probably one of the most exciting gifts you can give to a young child. Most kids are fascinated with the concept of driving. So having a little vehicle they can safely maneuver is awesome. We purchased this type of vehicle for all 3 of my kids. Everyone of them was thrilled. In fact, we parked them inside the garage facing forward as though they were &#34;parked&#34;.<br />This one sits a little high, so the child has to climb up to get on it. But they won't mind.<br />I would highly recommend elbow pads and a helmet. Though we've not seen our 4 wheeler turn over on us yet, but there were a couple of times going over some big bumps on the hilly areas that it looked as though it might tip. So steer your kids away from really bumpy areas and stay on mostly level ground. This is not a TRUE 4 wheeler. It is not designed for rough terrain. It is a TOY.<br />When it first arrives at your house, it might be best not to let the little ones know it's there. It has to be partly assembled and charge overnight (you have to plug it in) before it can be used. If you charge it less than the recommended time, the battery will never hold a charge for long.<br />Being that it runs on an oversize battery, it's only good for about 20 minutes of constant riding before it starts to lose some power.

My eyes tend to get really dry and itchy. I have a habit of rubbing my eyes, which just makes them worse. I've started using these drops when I feel the urge to rub my eyes, and they are great. They are soothing going in and my eyes don't feel dry or itchy for a while afterwards. I probably use them about 3 - 4 times a day, sometimes more when the weather is really dry. Now I just wish they made Similasan sinus drops.
10508	__label2__	4	N	Wireless	B00TSUVMBE	Speck Products MightyShell + FACEPLATE Case for iPhone 6/6S  - Black/Gravel Grey/Slate Grey	solid slim case, drains wallet	I've owned several Speck cases for various phones, and have never been disappointed.  This one is nice and slim and doesn't add too much bulk to the iPhone.  We've unfortunately dropped the phone several times already, even on the concrete garage floor no damage and very minimal scuffing of the case.<br />Camera and buttons are all accessible with no interference from the shell.<br />Comfortable in the hand texture-wise.<br /><br />My only real beef is the price.  It seems customers get bent over the barrel a bit when a new iPhone comes out.  An equivalent new-android phone case can be gotten for less than half the price, and tempered glass screen protectors are routinely under ten bucks.  The &#34;layers of radial impact geometry&#34; seems kind of gimmicky, when the other pure silicon Speck and off-brand cases I've owned have done as well of a job.

10510	__label2__	5	Y	Automotive	B001DZFZPG	Slime 70005 Safety Spair 7-Minute Flat Tire Repair System	Very Nice kit	I bought this Slime 70005 Safety Spair Tire Repair system to replace my Continental Tire Repair system which had a 2 year expiration date. This system is so much nicer and does not have a use by date so I am guessing it will last longer than the Continental system. In addition the Continental system will damage the Tire Pressure Monitors in your wheel where the Slime system says it will not. It has a nice light and is easy to use. I am hoping I never need it but it is comforting to know I have it in my Corvette which does not have a spare tire. It came fairly quicky and has a nice carry case with a reflective triangle on the back of the case to place while you are fixing the tire.
10511	__label2__	2	N	Baby	B000CSBP3G	BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Green/Yellow, 2 Pack	Not my choice for baby...	I can understand the premise and I like the premise.<br />However, I just don't believe that these bibs are comfortable for baby.<br /><br />While they are not hard, they are not soft.<br /><br />The Oxo Tot Roll Up bib has a truly soft front with a catch for whatever doesn't make it into baby's mouth.  It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn's plastic snap closure.<br /><br />Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier, while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.<br />But...Oxo can be rolled up for travel.
10512	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B00EABUR7G	Citizen Men's BM7277-50E Drive from Citizen Eco-Drive WDR Watch	World Time	There is no question Citizen and the high quality they have made of their watches over the years. Sadly, though they have faded down a bit because of the Drive 2.0 & 3.0 collections, where they have catered so much on the young, that the appeal of their class has died in the process. But they are trying to make a returning stance in great appeal watches. This WDR Eco-Drive watch is definitely a great return to the appeal Citizen had been known for throughout the years. What I also like about the watch is the excellent illumination on the hands, and the globe-style face on the watch. It definitely stands up very well. It is a elequent piece that looks great, and keeps great time on the wrist, without much worry. I suggest you go for this dark-tone piece, and see why Citizen for years has been known as being a world class.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: B 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: B
10513	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B005HPJZWC	Seiko Sportura Black Dial Black Leather Band Mens Watch	Sport Stop	There is no question why I do like Seiko and the kind of watches they have made over the past several years. Not just in style, but the quality has gotten better with the time they have made with the way we view time. Their Seiko Sportura watches are definitely in the ranking. This watch is a very simple and easy to care leather-strapped watch. I personally like how simple it is to read the stopwatch setting with the comfort of the strap around my wrist. It is a very strong watch that does what it is worth, and protects great  in water. I definitely recommend this watch if you are looking for a great watch that is sporty, and fine like china while telling time. Seiko has done that for years, and the Sportura is definitely following in suit like their other models have.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Comfort: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

I can get two filters for the price of one from the Ranch store in town, same thing. I have two riding mowers as I have 5 acres to mow every spring.  Your mower has to breath, this is so important.  So glad I looked on Amazon.  Paying $26.00 for one filter is just a joke.
10516	__label2__	5	Y	Home Improvement	B002UP6Y1M	5# 9 x 3-1/2" Tan Exterior Screws	Dependable high perfromance screws	These screws work great if you dont need stainless steel.  The best features are  what they dont do which is corrode, strip, or snap at the shanks.  I still dont understand the the switch to the star bits, they strip very easily and square drives like these are very hard to find in stores.

10518	__label2__	1	Y	Pet Products	B002AI39QW	Epi-Pet Sun Protector Spray for Pets	Dangerous dog sunscreen!!!	Very dangerous dog sunscreen!!! I bought this for my hairless Chinese Crested dog and had to take him to the vet.  Do your homework about dog sunscreens because some have toxic ingredients like this one(Benzophenone-3) which can cause contact eczema & absorbs into the body and does not process out.  Zinc oxide is toxic for dogs.Harmful ingredients are triethanolamine, Imidura, Methyl Paraben, DMDM Hydantoin.  Titanium dioxide is a good ingredient but the SAFEST is organic sunscreens for babies containing sunflower/jojoba seed oils, green tea leaf extracts, calendula flower/gingko leaf extracts, aloe juice, vitamin E, with titanium dioxide.  I'm looking at some brands at a local Whole Foods store which should be good.  Read the label carefully and I hope this helps you choose wisely.

Included is a chain guard, a user manual and a wrench conveniently stored in the handle of the saw. The battery was not fully charged but nearly so and took a short time to bring it up to a full charge. All I had to do was add some bar and chain oil and the saw was ready to go.<br /><br />There have been a number of storms the past few months and they broke off numerous branches and downed one very large tree. I have been doing some cleanup with a Stihl gas powered saw and a 40 volt Ryobi. They do a fairly nice job on the branches but not so good on the big tree. I slipped on my goggles and hauled this bad boy out to the big tree.  I started of with the trunk size of about 14 inches. This saw was nothing less than amazing as it cut through the tree trunk like a hot knife through butter. I continued until the tree was cut up and then worked on some branches and some trimming. This saw never slowed down and the battery just kept on keeping on.<br /><br />This is now my saw of choice. No more mixing oil and gas for the Stihl and no more charging the battery for the Ryobi. From now on it is just charge the Greenworks battery and keep a supply of bar and chain oil on hand.<br /><br />Yes, this saw does dribble a bit of oil as did the Ryobi and as did every chainsaw I ever owned. That is no big deal. All you need to do is slip some old newspaper or some rags or whatever under the saw when storing it and then check the oil level before the next use and you are good to go.

I am amazed at just how much wire goes in to wiring a small room... expect on just over 100' for a 12x12 room if you run it semi-hidden for a 5.1 system. Better get two spools for a 7.1, especially if you have a larger room.

It just had this horrible, awful scent that would not go away. I can't even describe it - just smelled like awful, cheap leather and my fingers would reek after touching it. Ended up throwing it out because it was so gross.

10529	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B00BLORPGG	Baofeng 2013 Newest Dual Band VHF and UHF Walkie Talkie, 5-watt, Black	Great for the price	I've been an Amateur Radio Operator for many years, and have more radios than I'll ever need. But when I see these Baofeng radios for under $50, I can't help myself. I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.<br /><br />Performance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.<br /><br />This is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price!!<br />Very good audio on TX and RX.<br />Good battery life.<br />Good sensitivity and selectivity.<br />Great features.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.<br />Programming cable not included.<br />Very quirky programming without the cable.<br />Channel skip is only available using the programming software.<br />SMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.<br />Very slow scan speed.
10530	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B00DOMOCCI	The Reservoir, Emergency Water Storage System 100 Gallons	100-gallon Bathtub Water Emergency Preparedness System "The Reservoir"	This is a very handy Preparedness option if you want to fill your bathtub with safe, potable drinking water (in advance, while water pressure is still available). These are widely offered all over the Internet at prices from $18 up. These are essentially just giant vinyl bags with a nozzle/cap closure. The same exact bag seems to be sold under various brand names, but it's the same product.    I like this simple concept. Here are some points to consider:    1. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Once full (even partially full), this thing will weigh a ton. Completely full, 100 gallons weighs 800 pounds.  It's not portable. You're not going to be lifting it out of the tub and carrying it anywhere. The vinyl would likely not survive 800 lbs of stress even if you had the manpower to lift it.    2. Once it's in place and full, your bathtub (and/or shower) are out of action and can't be used for anything else...like bathing, or decontaminating anything. So this works best if you have multiple bathrooms/tubs in order to spare one for water storage.    3. These are one-time-use items. Once you use it, and empty it, the vinyl bag is just too large to dry thoroughly after it's emptied. So there's that. On the other hand, 100 gallons of water (at 1 gallon per person per day) is a great resource.    4. If portability is a concern, you can achieve much the same thing using clean large plastic storage bins (Sterilite brand or similar) and stacking those in the tub. Same concept but capable of being moved if necessary.    SUMMARY: If you have a bathtub you can afford to dedicate solely to water storage in an emergency, this is a fast, easy, simple and clever solution to hold 90 days+ of survival water for one person, 45+ days for 2 people, etc. It pays to comparison shop on price. It's large, and a challenge to dry to dry out hygienically for possible re-use (consider a blow dryer and a funnel?), so I consider this a 100-gallon 'disposable'. On the whole, at around $20, this is a great solution at a low price for 100 gallons. Just make sure you have a tub you are willing to dedicate solely to water storage.    Hope this is helpful. Stay safe and happy trails, everybody.    PS: I just read reviewer Jennifer Gonzales's comments that people often overlook that they already have a ready source of clean emergency water in their home water heater. That's very true, and good to remember. There are lots of good how-to videos on YouTube on this--you'll just need to know in advance which valves are involved, and most units will need a crescent wrench to open the faucet type drain at the base of the heater.
10531	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B0066T2IAY	Fossil Men's JR1357 Nate Chronograph Black Leather Watch	Beautiful large watch with easy to read clean face	As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.<br /><br />The band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.<br /><br />The watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the "start/stop" timer function.  The lower button is the "reset" button once you've stopped the timer.<br /><br />One of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.<br /><br />This is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.<br /><br />4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing.

10534	__label2__	4	N	Toys	B00IQ8MTH0	Fisher-Price Little People Place Musical Preschool Playset	A fun preschool set!	I rated Fisher Price Little People set 4 stars because it is a cute musical preschool play set. I am generally happy with all the Little People sets I have and this is a great addition. I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting!<br /><br />The magical color rug doesn't really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; &#34;It's time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!&#34;<br /><br />I didn't rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I'll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a &#34;new&#34; feeling toy.<br /><br />Overall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play. If your looking to add to your current collection or just start one of Little Poeple play sets, this is a good one!

After a while, this got so hot, it melted the plastic and warped it so bad the Rigid "Power" Spin was destroyed.  This should be renamed to "Flimsy Melt" Spin instead.  A drain cleaner that can be powered by drill or motor should always be made of metal, not plastic.  I recommend General Pipe Cleaners R-25SM instead, which is built MUCH tougher and still reasonably priced.

They are really bright and 20 come made up in one component.  I'll drive them with a Solar charged battery and little wind generator and turn them on and off with a motion PIR controller.  This is one of the best bargains in LED lighting I have found.  Very much worth the money paid.  Very satisfied.  Can be purchased in bulk at a considerable savings per 20 strip units of Three little LEDs per strip.  Get one and play with it. The plastic, which absorbs heat and then melts needs to be removed and replace with something to remove the heat, air circulation is a must.

But it's equally intriguing to see him hold back in her presence.<br />Jon Foster, Russell Crowe, and the other cast members do well in their roles, although the motives as mentioned above may leave you scratching your head.
10541	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B00BI9MDSO	AmazonBasics Heavy-Duty Vault Case for PlayStation Vita and Vita Slim (Officially Licensed by Sony)	Solid case	This is a really good case and I feel like my Vita would be adequately protected if I were to drop this case (not that I'd TRY, mind you, but I feel secure with it in this case).<br /><br />That said,  I have a couple of wishes:<br /><br />1.  The case can hold 3 game cartridges and 1 memory card.  I WISH that it could hold 6 and no memory card.  I have a 32 GB card and I don't intend on switching these out.<br />2.  I wish it had a detachable strap...even a hand strap would be great.  The case is fairly large and carrying it for extended periods means you need to have a secure grip on it.<br /><br />Other than that, top marks - great case!

10544	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00JX9HMXM	V8: V-Fusion Peach Mango Juice, 46 Fl Oz(Pack of 4)	Tasty and Healthy ~ Great with Seltzer, Too!	If you are wanting to get more vegetables in your diet, these fusion drinks which combine fruit juices with vegetable juices are a savvy way to do so. This peach mango mixes the juice of sweet potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and yellow carrots with the juice of white grapes, apples, oranges, peaches and mango puree. You really taste the peach-mango flavor with the other subtle flavors as nuances.<br /><br />It is 100% juice with no ADDED sugar. However, it does include natural fruit sugar, as all juices do, which is part of the fruit juice - 26g sugar in a one cup serving. What I like to do is use about 1/8 cup - which would be about 3.5g of fruit sugar and 20 calories - and put it in a cup of seltzer with ice to make a refreshing and healthy drink. One cup of this fruit-vegetable fusion drink is 120 calories, but you can dilute it with seltzer to give it fizz and less calories for a refreshing, healthy and tasty beverage. It provides 100% of daily vitamin C and 20% vitamin A in one serving.<br /><br />It's a great concept to mix fruit and vegetable juices in a healthy fusion drink like this which is naturally delicious. Of all the V8fusion drinks, this is one of my favorites. Mango and peach together are so refreshing and rather tropical tasting.
10545	__label2__	5	Y	Books	0062202715	Nothing Gold Can Stay: Stories	Interesting, Intriguing and Often Surprising	I enjoyed each and every one of these stories. Ron Rash has a way with words and his stories are interesting, intriguing and often surprising.<br /><br />In The Trusty, a prisoner gets loose and with the help of a woman he sees his way to freedom only to have things turn on him in the end.<br /><br />In Cherokee, Danny goes to a casino hoping to win enough money to pay off his debt. He and his wife check in to the hotel and Danny carefully plays the slot machines.<br /><br />A man who considers himself a 'Servant of History' looks into the etiology of songs. His search for these beginnings ends up turning around and harming him.<br /><br />Those Who Are Dead Are Only Now Forgiven was one of my favorite stories in the collection. A college student is in love with Lauren who has turned into a meth-head. He tries to free her from her addiction but ends up giving himself to her and her demons.<br /><br />The Dowry is another of my favorites. A family is totally against the marriage of their daughter and is about to kill her fiance when a pastor steps in to make things right and evens up the score.<br /><br />All of the stories have panache and I read them aloud to my husband as we were driving. It was great to hear the words spoken and to share the book with someone else. It is a welcome addition to Rash's repertoire of works and I plan to read his other short stories soon. For those of you who enjoyed 'Serena', these stories will not be disappointing.
10546	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B004D4SW5O	ViSalus Body By Vi Challenge Shape Kit, 48 meals, 10 mix-ins	I love these shakes	I have never been a big fan of custom diets.  I have tried many before and got tired of the same thing over and over again.  I had some friends that were part of the cult that is ViSalus and kept trying to sell me on the product.  I finally broke down and bought it on Amazon instead of through them because it was cheaper and I am not being bothered to reorder and such.  Now for the product review:<br /><br />I love these shakes.  I am moderately active to begin with.  I play baseball once a week, I like to go outside and do yard work and I also have a woodshop that involves carrying heavy pieces of machinery and lumber around.  However I was 6'0&#34; and 205 pounds and really needed to drop some weight.  I thought 10 or 20 pounds would be good and I'd be fine.  Well after losing 20 in just a little over 2 months, I am now almost down 30 in just over 3 months and very happy with the results.<br /><br />It tells you to drink 2 shakes a day and a sensible meal but let's be honest, we humans love food.  I did the opposite of what everyone tells you, which is to get on the scale once a week or once a month.  I get on everyday.  Morning and night.  I really wanted to track my habits and how I lost each day.<br /><br />I found the best thing for me is a bowl of Quaker Oatmeal in the morning (brown sugar maple), a shake for lunch (look on pinterest and find shake recipes), and a sensible meal like a turkey sandwich or wrap or salad or something at night.  If I wanted a snack I will eat something like an apple with peanut butter or some Special K cracker chips or something healthy.  I was not extremely careful in calorie counting but I do go over my options and choose the best one.  Don't get me wrong, you will want food, food, and more food while on this diet.  Just as you will with any diet.<br /><br />The shakes are not that great by themselves.  Tastes like a typical protein shake.  I mix it with almond milk and other ingredients and come up with a less than 200 calorieshake that tastes great.  My favorite for instance is 2 scoops of powder, one cup of almond milk, 1 tablespoon of PB2(look this stuff up, it's awesome), 1 tablespoon of chocolate Fat free Jello pudding mix, and one teaspoon of caramel flavoring.  Throw in a handful of ice cubes and blend and it tastes like a snickers.  As I said before, you can look on pinterest or other sites and find recipes for different shake flavors that are great and PB2 instead of peanut butter provides half the calories and fat.<br /><br />So all in all, I would highly recommend this diet for someone that knows how to stick to a diet.  I lost 20 pounds in over 2 months with no time at the gym.  After that 20 it was a little harder to lose so I now work out about 3 times a week and I feel and look great.  I am still losing but I am also adding muscle so I don't notice the weight drop as much but it's still there.  All with just one shake a day instead of 2.
10547	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B00B9J319S	Alpatronix 4-in-1 Protective PU Leather Classic Black Case for Apple iPad 4 Retina Display and iPad 3 with Built-In Stand: Auto Sleep Smart Cover Function / All Ports Easily Accessible / Lightweight / Slim Fit with Soft Interior Lining and Leather Protection Against Stains, Scratches and Splash. Great for use at Home, Work, Travel and Outdoors. Exclusive 1-Year Warranty (Comes In Retail Packaging)	Great Value	This case is a nice value for the money. It certainly isn't the fanciest case out there, but it is very nice considering the low cost.<br /><br />When &#34;tenting&#34; your ipad there are 4 different options for height, so you have plenty of options for positioning. The cover latches closed and does not come off on its own - a feature I appreciate when travelling with the ipad. I don't have to worry about something being able to get in contact with the screen and scratching it. They way the ipad fits into the case is also secure, so you do not need to worry about your ipad falling out of the case.
10548	__label2__	4	N	Home	B00A2VND0Q	Eureka AirSpeed Pet Bagless Upright Vacuum, AS1002A	Strong Suction, light to push	I found this vacuum easy to put together.  It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.<br /><br />It IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.<br /><br />Features I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers.<br /><br /> Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range. I've used it about a month and haven't noticed a decrease, if it doesn't last over time, I'll update this review.<br /><br />MY DISLIKES:  It's bulky and big to store, and it is heavy.  While this is not a problem PUSHING it, it might be if you need to carry it around. Replacement filters for the HEPA filtration system might be expensive.  I wish the cord was retractable.  I don't see a way to turn the brushes off for hardwood floors.

10551	__label2__	5	Y	Beauty	B008HBMRRS	Burt's Bees Intense Hydration Day Lotion, 1.8 Ounces	Perfectly moisturized	My new favorite face lotion. I was a long time user of Olay, but the changed the formula of my usual brand and I didn't like the perfumy odor. My skin is sensitive to begin with so I'm always reluctant to try another brand--it's usually 50/50 as to whether my skin will break out. I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well. Having used Burt's Bees products before I took a chance. I am so glad I did. It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in. I have been using it for almost a month and NO break outs. In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized. You also do not need to use a lot. One pump is all you need, and even that a little too much...so I just rub the excess on my hands. I am very impressed by this lotion. I did not expect it to feel this good and most importantly no residue!

10553	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00062N428	German EKG Caliper	great for fine woodworking and precision joinery	I got these on a whim.  I needed a set of accurate dividers for fine woodworking projects that involved copying and transfering small measurements - at the level of a few thousandths.  The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn't want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.<br /><br />These calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5", but the effective usable span is more like 7", so they're not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado's, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn't matter much.<br /><br />At $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I'm familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don't do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.<br /><br />This might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.
10554	__label2__	3	Y	Outdoors	B00508TE40	2PCS Red LED Flash Tyre Wheel Valve Cap Light for Car Bike bicycle Motorbicycle Wheel Light Tire Light	Dimensional problems	These are male threaded and come with a female to female coupler.  This makes them stand too far off of the wheel rim.<br />Combine with the valve stem, the thickness of the light unit, plus the plastic light tube, and this could only really be used on a very small wheel.  Using on 26&#34; wheels, these bend off to the side, back and forth.<br /><br />Also, these are all plastic, with poor clearances.  You won't keep water, dust, and air off of the valves with these.
10555	__label2__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B00IR99G7Y	#1 Barbecue Grill Light with 10 Super Bright LED Lights - Durable, Weather Resistant, Versatile LED BBQ Lights for Outdoor Grilling (Black)	BBQ's best invention (if only it was weather proof!)	[[VIDEOID:8712406df7dc5717aaeb927ed7c07d07]] No more burned meat! This happens way too much: I awkwardly shine a flashlight on my steak, it looks done, I bring it inside, cut it open... and it still needs another 5 minutes.  This light has saved me much annoyance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It actually fits perfectly on my BBQ.  I was very stoked.<br />- Lights up the entire grill with brilliant blue LED light.<br />- Comes with 3 AA batteries in box (not all companies do that! But obviously Brigmon does!)<br />- Black color stays out-of-sight (as opposed to a bright white colored light)<br />- Once installed it stays secure.<br />- The people at Brigmon are very nice folks (they're the ones who sent me this light to review and test. A lot of sellers sell this light on Amazon, but I would suggest going through these nice folks.)(no I don't work for them... they really are friendly).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Have to take it off/on if you're not using it (see note below).<br /><br />Note: If you live in a warm climate (e.g. CA or AZ), then by all means this is a must-have.  However for my personal use here in the PNW weather, I must take this on/off to use it because I don't want it to get ruined in the rain. Or if you have a rain cover, just tuck this underneath (if it fits).<br /><br />Overall, a 4/5 stars product.  Really if you love to BBQ, this is a must-have toy.  (I guess it'd make a great gift too)

I put a different pad on it though because the one that comes with it is a bit like a sponge and I didn't want to come to the tree and sit on a wet sponge. I didn't actually test its porosity but it sure looks like a sponge and I didn't want to find out the hard way.

I have small lady hands and found the small size not too tight, but tight enough to provide moderate compression. The only problem is that the gloves get a bit sweaty and stick to hands when being pulled off  (unlike the other brand I bought on Amazon last year). I also got a bit of a rash in the base of my thumb, probably from sweat. But the warmth does help with arthritis.

It keeps my laptop nice and steady while computing on the sofa.  Very innovative design with lots of positions possible.  I've already settled on my favorite.  The numbers on the pivot points really help with remembering alternate configurations.  The fans are a bit noisy at times but nothing terrible. The side platform is nice to have but I decided not to use it just yet. The 2 plastic clamps go along the bottom edge and help hold your laptop in place when tilting the table at extreme angles.  It's lightweight but feels durable. Should have got this long ago.

I have used the conditioner and leave in treatment in this hair care line and love both.  I was excited to test this specially formulated shampoo as well.  Once I received it and read the label I was very disappointed to learn this contains sulfates the evil enemy of Keratin users.<br />This suds up nicely and smells great.  My hair was left feeling clean, yet I had that sinking feeling I was damaging my hair.  I'll continue to use the conditioner and leave in treatment, but I'm sticking with no sulfate, no suds shampoos.
10565	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B00C1LIYWM	Safe Haven	Nicholas Sparks Romance with Just a Little Bit of Mystery	Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />“Safe Haven” is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallström (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance “Dear John” a few years ago), “Safe Haven” is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For “Safe Haven” attempts to be a “mystery” – in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie’s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.

My opinion is that it is purchased by the company from a vendor who also sells this exact bulb to Feit and a few others (such as what is available at the large name home repair shops).  Diecast heat-sinks and  a good lens make for a nice bulb. I'm happy with my purchase and at this price definitely recommend it.

My video says it all and shows how to piggyback this compressor.  You'll see that I hold this rig on a hand truck, which makes it easy to move around. I can still pull the compressor off the hand truck easily, for times when I don't need to extra tank and just want to put the compressor in the truck or something like that.

10570	__label2__	5	N	Furniture	B00IKWTLC8	Chelsea DSW Molded Plastic Dining Side Chairs (Set of 2) (White, DSW Side Chair)	Comfy, easy to assemble and great for any room.	Extra chairs are something I've been in need of for a while. Something versatile is always good, and these chairs from Chelsea Eames Style certainly fit the bill. They can be assembled in minutes, are pretty sturdy and are comfortable to sit in for any length of time. Looking at them in the stock images, they might not look like much. When you're sitting in one, however, you might want to switch out your old computer desk chair for one of these. Plastic chairs will probably always look 'kiddy' no matter how you look at it, appearing as the kind of thing you'd see in an elementary school. I actually like how the chairs look in-person, and wouldn't be against getting another set because of how reliable they are.<br /><br />The chairs come packed in one box, and in a way where it's practically impossible for them to get damaged during shipping. They have little foam covers on the screw holes, and all the tools are included in a little bag, one taped to each chair. Yep, everything you need to assemble these is included! Assembly only takes a couple of minutes once everything is out of the box. The instructions are easy to follow- you'll have it down after the first chair and not need them for the second. Once they're set, put them where you want and get sitting!<br /><br />There's not much else I can say aside from the fact that they're comfy. The backs have a bit of give so you can lean back a little, and they're very light, making transporting them a breeze. Cleaning them up is equally easy, them being plastic and all. My home has hardwood floors and there haven't been any scratches from the legs when they've been moved or bumped.<br /><br />I got a pair in black, mainly because I felt they'd look better over time with use. Both the white and red are good colors too, and it could be fun to get one set in each color. These things deserve the high review rating.
10571	__label2__	5	N	PC	B00HZR4EEE	OCZ Storage Solutions Vertex 460 Series 240GB SATA III 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive (SSD) With Acronis True Image HD Cloning Software- VTX460-25SAT3-240G	solid, fast mid-sized SSD	A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a "I love my SSD" sticker.<br /><br />Write performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes ("dd" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place.<br /><br />The "sweet spot" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious).<br /><br />The OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage.<br /><br />A fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba. Recommended.

Installs very firmly on my gas block and lines up perfectly with the front sight.

10580	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B000795XMY	K&H Manufacturing Deluxe Kitty Sill With Bolster Tan Kitty Print 14-Inch by 24-Inch	Wonderful perch!	We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable.  Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<br /><br />There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<br /><br />The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.
10581	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00PTL3TKI	Graco Contender 65 Convertible Car Seat, Chili Red	Compact, fair price, will last from infant to about 3 years old.	This car seat seems like a decent inexpensive solution for your child.    Pros:  - Small, can fit in the middle of a small sedan and still fit 2 adults at either side without much hassle.  - Easy to install... Some other car seats leave a lot to be desired.  - Will last from 5 to 40 pounds, which is about from birth till about 3 years of age. (obviously varies depending on child, this is just a rough estimate) This is for back facing carseat.  - Goes up to 65 pounds for forward facing.  - Buckles work fine. My other Graco had buckles "voluntarily recalled" this one has the newer styles already, so I don't foresee a recall. They are easy to adjust and to buckle  on or off.    Cons  - I have other Graco car seats, and the cushion/fabric seems like it's better quality than this. This was a small disappointment.    Overall, if you are looking for a first carseat, and got less than 150 to spend, this is a good choice.

10583	__label2__	5	N	Watches	B007EHOAS0	Stuhrling Original Men's 168S.33151 "Classic" Stainless Steel Automatic Watch with Leather Band	A beautiful watch, 2 different band colors, but one design flaw may or may not be important to tyou	This is actually a beautiful piece, especially if you have a guy who usually prefers a sports watch but sometimes needs a dress watch for dressier occasions. This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.<br /><br />Better yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.<br /><br />I personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.<br /><br />The face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.<br /><br />That said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.<br /><br />But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.

Alternatively, if you like to be super organized, these go well on all those boxes in the basement or garage that seem to have a million knick knacks and no descriptions.

In my experience, there are no problems with this item.
10588	__label2__	3	N	Watches	B00KCF7ETI	Citizen Eco-Drive Men's AW1361-01E Sport Stainless Steel Watch with Leather Band	Solar Watch?	When it has came down to Citizen watches, they have been both a hit and a miss in regards to their value. They have had a huge hit with making classic and distinctive watches, and have a big miss when it has came down to catering to younger horologists with timepieces. Their Drive collection has honestly lagged in terms of design and distinction as well as quality for the long-term owner of a timepiece. This timepiece from Citizen, actually does more to confuse the owner than drive in regards to the overall value of the piece. It does have a lovely leather strap and significant movement, but that is really all there is to it. What I do not like about the watch is that you see the watch in 3 directions. The second display seems much bigger on the watch, while the regular time display, and the military display seem much smaller and weaker on the watch. Overall, it is a noble watch, but there are better ones Citizen has made overall for the money.<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: C+<br /><br />Overall: C

10592	__label2__	4	N	Office Products	B00P9SI8IE	iGearPro Multifunctional Voice Recorder - Portable Rechargeable Digital Audio Dictaphone - MP3 Player (8GB)	More Useful as an MP3 Player than a WAV Recorder	I received a free item to review.  The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range.

10594	__label2__	1	Y	Sports	B001IEKZDO	Omron Home Blood Pressure Kit Large, Blue/Black - 104MAJ	Don't expect this to last even a year.  They don't make replacement parts, so you'll have to buy another one soon.	Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1&#34;, and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13&#34; cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts

10596	__label2__	5	Y	Home Improvement	B000HE7YQM	M-D Building Products 1025 All-Climate Auto and Marine 17-Feet Weather Seal Strip, Black	Highly versatile weather seal	Looking over these reviews you see a wide variety of applications for this versatile weather seal.  My two uses to date:    1.)  Insulation for the door of this humidor - [[ASIN:B005KLQURG Havana Cigar Cafe Display Humidor]].  I found that sponge rubber weatherstripping compressed too much in a short period of time and was not providing the necessary seal.  This rubber weather seal worked out perfectly for this application.    2.)  Bed rail fastener gasket - this is a much less conventional use for this product but it was effective for me.  My bed has a wooden head and foot board with wooden side rails that fasten to the foot/head boards with metal hardware.  With movement on the bed the friction of the side rails against the head/foot boards resulted in a distracting squeaking sound.  I used this rubber weather seal as a gasket where these pieces meet and it eliminated the noise.  In fact, I can't believe just how well it worked for this purpose and suggest you give it a try if you encounter this same annoyance.    I purchased this in September of 2014 and paid $6.99.  I'm very happy with the performance of this product.

It's almost certain that I will inadvertently leave it on from time to time, draining battery life.<br /><br />I borrowed my daughter's 10&#34; pad to see about the functionality, and we agreed that the tablet holding &#34;stretchy bands&#34; worked better than it initially appeared would be the case, and the weight of her pad nicely balanced the easel function.  Without a pad inserted, it had seemed far less stable.<br /><br />The case closes to a secure and thin unit that offers moderate protection.  Again, not bad.<br /><br />Writing this, I've already had keys stick a few times, creating text liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike this.<br /><br />The instant &#34;Tap Launch&#34; feature is a nicely considered one, as are the iconographic function keys at the top of the keyboard,but overall the KeyFolio is going to offer a mixed bag of helpful features and needless frustrations to the user.  i'd say wait for the next version of this model.

10600	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00M552Q0K	Michael Nyman: Make it Louder, Please! [Blu-ray]	Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself	Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself<br /><br />For some reason, music stores and concert programs file British composer Michael Nyman under “Classical Music”. I find this interesting because that’s not really what Nyman’s music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for “The Piano” and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a “classical composer”?<br /><br />Next is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his “pieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nyman’s work is fast and he “borrows” tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nyman’s work.<br /><br />This wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthaus’s intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nyman’s tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled “Musicologist Scorse”. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nyman’s “hits” (but not “The Piano” and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus – for those not familiar with the composer – is a 52-minute film “Michael Nyman – Composer in Progress” from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but it’s nice to have it here as a bonus.<br /><br />If you are a Nyman fan like me, you’ll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the “portrait” first and then the concert.<br />The BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”
